# Neural-Style-Transfer

## About
Using Style Transfer allows users to apply visual style or appearance of one image to another. We make use of a CNN to extract features (shape, borders etc) of first image and style (colors, brush stroke, texture etc) of second image. Finally to generate the output image we apply the style of the second image to the first image.

## How to use
1) Download/Clone the GitHub repository 
2) Open the 'Style_Transfer_Exercise.ipynb' file.
3) Follow the instructions provided in the notebook and run all the cells in the notebook.

NOTE : Use of a GPU is highly recommended during training process
